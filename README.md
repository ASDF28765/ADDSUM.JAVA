//Welcome Everyone, I am a Junior Java Developer. This is a small project I worked on.
//The Code interact with the user, ask for two numbers, and then add them together, giving a result at the end. 
//The Code will then give you the result of both of them.


//I am thankful to be part of this amazing community of developer, where anyone can learned and grow together. 
//All new and experience Software Developer, thank you. Any feedback is encouraged.
